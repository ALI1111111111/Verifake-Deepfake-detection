# Flutter Mobile App

This directory contains a basic Flutter application that mirrors the React frontend.
The platform folders were omitted to keep the repository small. To run the app:

1. Install Flutter and run `flutter create .` inside this `flutter` directory to generate the missing platform files.
2. Replace the generated `lib` folder with the one in this repo.
3. Run `flutter pub get` and `flutter run`.

The app expects the Laravel backend to be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
